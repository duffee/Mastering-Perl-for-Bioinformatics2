# Object Oriented Perl

While the first edition built up the features of a class bit by bit,
with Moose we will just jump right in with the final class.
It takes care of everything under the hood.

## What is Moose ... or Moo?

Modern Perl realized that a lot of the class description was just boilerplate,
repetitive code that's needed but not fun to write.

Moose ripped that up, hid the boilerplate and made simple classes easy to understand and write
... but it was a little heavy trying to be all things to all people.

Moo takes the most useful features of Moose and makes it faster.
It trades a little bit of the flexibility for startup speed.
Use this one in production if you can.

An excelent introduction to Moose is
