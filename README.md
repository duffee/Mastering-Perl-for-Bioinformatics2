# Mastering-Perl-for-Bioinformatics2

Source code for an updated version of the O'Reilly classic, Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics

## Why a Second edition

Written over 20 years ago, **Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics** was trying to teach
scientists how to get the most of the Perl language. One of the stand out features of
Perl is that the code examples presented in that book _still runs on the latest Perl_.
Backwards compatability is a core value of the Perl dev team, even when it gets
in the way of progress. this doesn't mean that the language is static. The last
15 years have seen a steady stream of new features added, ..... and .....

From TIMTOWTDI to Perl Best Practices, we have worked out better ways of coding
for maintainability. Following this style for readability, your colleagues should
be able to use an modify your scripts long after you've moved on.

State of technology has moved with the times and Perl has moved with it.
This second edition will update the code examples to Modern Perl standards
and present deeper programming concepts to promote professional software development.

## But everybody says Just Use Python

There is still a lot of Perl code used in production that has gone through months of
writing, debugging and testing. Are you going to throw that effort away because
of the casual opinion of someone who isn't going lose months of their time
re-inventing the wheel.

### But nobody else in my group will understand it ...

After years of being told that Perl is unreadable,
Python programmers are astonished when they first see a _class_ in Modern Perl
and intuitively understand what it represents. They think it's impossible.
